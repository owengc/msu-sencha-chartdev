Construct and interpret a two-way table summarizing  data on two categorical variables collected from the same subjects.  Use relative frequencies calculated for rows or columns to describe  possible association between the two variables. For example, collect data from students in your class on whether or not they have a curfew on school nights and whether or not they have assigned chores at home. Is there evidence that those who have a curfew also tend to have chores?",
